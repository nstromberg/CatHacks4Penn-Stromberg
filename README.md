# CatHacks4Penn-Stromberg

~~~ScheduleOptimizer3000~~~

This project is intended to be a way for students attending UK (and in the future, other schools) to get a list of the top-rated 
combinations of sections for the classes they need and/or want to take that fit their preferences for an ideal schedule. For example, users
will be able to enter that they want their classes to be compact, that they want to finish their classes as early as possible each day (or
start them as late as possible), and the app will pop out the top 5-10 rated schedules for them based on those preferences.

The app was started at the CatHacksIV hackathon, and is currently under development.
